<details class="question–item">
<summary>Introduction: purpose for Open type exhibition?</summary>
<div class="answer">
<p>For OpenType, well, because I'm both a designer and an artist, I always thought of design as art or as an art form in its own right. But there was always an ongoing conversation with one of our mentors next door whether design is considered art or not.
And there's always this feeling that design is too commercial to be art and it always serves a purpose and I wanted to create a space where design can be exhibited and typography especially can be exhibited beyond the commercial space and can live without necessarily serving a commercial purpose and it can be just expressed for the sake of it and I find that art doesn't need permission to be expressive just for the sake of it but design always needs to save a purpose so I thought it would be great to present design as art so yeah that was the initial.</P>
